## Profession Assessment
	
The completion of my coursework in the Computer Science program and the creation of this ePortfolio have been transformative experiences that have influenced my professional aspirations and equipped me with the necessary skills to enter the competitive field of computer science. This ePortfolio is intended to demonstrate my technical proficiency, problem-solving abilities, and capacity to provide scalable, well-organized solutions. I have refined the skills required to make a meaningful contribution to any team or project by engaging in a combination of coursework, collaboration, and hands-on projects.

I was presented with a variety of opportunities to demonstrate my capabilities and develop professionally throughout the program. For instance, my capacity to devise object-oriented, modular solutions to real-world issues was underscored by the development of a Bank Simulator Program as part of a software development course. In the same vein, a team project on database design enabled me to work with my peers to develop a complex query-supporting, highly efficient, and normalized database, demonstrating my technical proficiency and ability to function effectively in a team setting.
	
Additionally, this journey served to confirm my professional principles: I prioritize security, collaboration, and the production of clean, maintainable code in order to achieve optimal outcomes. Through coursework and practical applications, these principles have been deeply ingrained in me, equipping me for positions that prioritize communication, adaptability, and problem-solving.

The program's emphasis on straightforward communication and the division of responsibilities was a lesson I learned from working within teams. For example, I served as the main developer for a capstone project, which involved the coordination of tasks, the resolution of conflicts, and the guarantee that all stakeholders' needs were satisfied. These experiences have further solidified my capacity to excel in collaborative environments.

My initiatives were contingent upon effective communication. I have honed my ability to cater my communication to the audience, ensuring alignment and clarity, whether I am presenting a software design to peers or explaining technical challenges to non-technical stakeholders. Our coursework concentrated on the optimization of efficacy by employing data structures like binary trees and hash tables, as well as algorithms like quicksort. One of the most notable accomplishments was the development of a pathfinding algorithm for a maze-solving AI. I successfully employed Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently navigate intricate mazes.
	
I have experience in the design of scalable applications and the management of relational databases. For example, during a database administration course, I developed a fully normalized schema that facilitated optimized querying for a Contact system. End-to-end robustness in projects is guaranteed by my capacity to integrate backend functionality with software design principles. Security has been a consistent priority, particularly in a information security¬†course where I implemented secure authentication systems and acquired the ability to identify vulnerabilities in software architecture. This knowledge has influenced my "security-first" perspective, which guarantees the privacy and integrity of my work.
